# Todo List App
It is a Todo List App. In this App User can create Tasks , Edit Tasks , and Delete tasks. This Tasks will save in Local Storage of Browser even if the user close their Browser or PC it will Remain. Until they manually cleared it.

User can Create Task by clicking Add task Button. They can Write task name and Give Priority of that Task.There are 3 types of Priority Low, Medium and High. And they can Not Add it if the task name is empty.

User can Delete Task By click Delete button . After Clicking it User need to confirm it to delete the task.

By Clicking Edit Button User can Edit task name and priority.

Users can also check completed or not completed by clicking check button.

All this will be Store automatically in local storage when ever task changes via useEffect hook. And Store all useState hook.

I did not use any state management tools(ContextApi , Redux ToolKit etc) because it is too small app to use this kind of tools.

Its a super Simple app for Task Management.
